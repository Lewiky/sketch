# sketch
sketch coursework C 

This program takes in a custom binary .sketch file and converts the bits to custom
opcodes and operands, which then give instruction to a turtle-like device that draws
the pattern described in the .sketch file to the screen, including pauses and putting the
pen up and down.

It requires SDL2 for the graphics and a gcc makefile is included.
